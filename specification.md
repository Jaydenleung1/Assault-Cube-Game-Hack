For my Something Awesome Project, I'd like to create a hack for a game, specifically in Assault Cube on Windows 10. Game hacking has always fascinated me ever since I faced my first cheater! Through game hacking, I will learn the art of reverse engineering whilst having fun and playing games. After completing this project, I hope to have learnt some knowledge of the inner works of game engines and the fundamentals of how hacks are created for games.
